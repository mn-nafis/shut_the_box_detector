# üß† Shut The Box - Game State Detection with YOLOv8

A Python project to detect and track the state of the board game **Shut the Box** using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. It identifies the state (open/closed) of all 9 tiles and detects dice values in real-time using a webcam.

## üìå Features

- Real-time game state detection using a camera
- Detects:
  - Tiles: open/closed states for tiles 1 to 9
  - Dice values (1‚Äì6)
- Determines possible valid moves given the dice roll
- Automatically ends game when no valid move is left and give the score

## üß† How It Works

1. **YOLOv8** detects tile states and dice values from camera input.
2. **Tile labels** are mapped to tile numbers and their states (open/closed).
3. **Dice values** are summed.
4. The game logic calculates and suggests a valid move (sum of open tiles equals dice value).
5. Game ends when no valid move is possible.
